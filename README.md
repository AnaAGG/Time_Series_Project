# Time_Series_Project
The aim of this project is to make predictions of the evolution of temperature and CO2 emissions using Time Series.

- Seasonality — Seasonality is a repeating pattern within a fixed period like the example above, about the sales revenue in the holiday season.

- Irregularity– It is also known as noise, so these are erratic, or you can say unsystematic. This happens only for a short duration, and it is non-repeating. It is a random part of the data. There is no specific pattern, which makes it difficult to be factored into an analysis.
