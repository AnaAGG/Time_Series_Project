# Time_Series_Project
The aim of this project is to make predictions of the evolution of temperature and CO2 emissions using Time Series. 

## The problem

Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.

Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change are now occurring: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves.

## **Time Series Components**



- **Autocorrelation**

    Autocorrelation is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them.

- **Seasonality**

    Seasonality is a repeating pattern within a fixed period. Refers to periodic fluctuations. For example, electricity consumption is high during the day and low during night, or high temperatures in summer and lower in winter.

- **Stationarity**

    Stationarity is an important characteristic of time series. A time series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties do not change over time. In other words, it has constant mean and variance, and covariance is independent of time.
